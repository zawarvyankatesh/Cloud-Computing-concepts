What is Cloud Computing ?
Cloud computing is basically a way of accessing computing resources over the internet without needing to own and maintain expensive hardware and software infrastructure. With cloud computing, you can rent servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence on a pay-per-use or subscription basis. This means you only pay for what you need and use, and you can access these resources from anywhere with an internet connection.

There are three main types of cloud computing services. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) lets you rent physical or virtual machines, storage, and other resources from a cloud provider. Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides developers with a platform for building and deploying applications, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. And Software as a Service (SaaS) allows you to use software applications hosted on a cloud provider's servers, without needing to install them on your own device.

Cloud computing has a lot of benefits. It can save you money by eliminating the need to buy and maintain hardware and software. It's also highly scalable, meaning you can easily increase or decrease your usage based on your needs. It's flexible and reliable, allowing you to access your resources from anywhere and reducing the risk of downtime. Cloud computing also makes it easier to collaborate and innovate by enabling you to rapidly deploy new applications and services.
